# Nike Sale Data Web Scraping Project

This project involves scraping Nike sale data from the Nike web store using Python programming language. The project utilizes Google Colab, Selenium, Beautiful Soup and Pandas libraries to enable infinite scrolling on the concerned page, extract data and store it in a CSV file.

### Libraries Used

**BeautifulSoup**: A Python library that is used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files.

**Selenium**: A Python library that is used to automate web browser interaction from Python.

**Pandas**: A Python library that is used for data manipulation and analysis.

**Time**: A Python library that is used to add a delay between consecutive page scrolls.

### Key Information
